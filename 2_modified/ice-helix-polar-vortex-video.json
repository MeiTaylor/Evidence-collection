    "content": "Every few years, when the cold, arctic air of the polar vortex plunges south, internet users around the globe are treated to viral videos about the cold snap. Examples include frozen sculptures made of ramen and clothes as stiff as a board. You can even throw hot water into the air and watch it turn into a white cloud of steam and ice.\nTikTok user QueenChelsea wanted to take it a step further in January 2024, posting a video to her TikTok and Instagram page showing her pouring water on the ground and creating a helix out of ice. The video quickly went viral, with over 13 million likes on TikTok (with 191 million views) and over 5 million likes on Instagram. The frozen sculpture looked real enough to fool many commenters, and Snopes received emails inquiring if the video was real.\n\nUnfortunately, Canada being cold was the only real part of the video. Sorry to burst anyone's bubble (another great thing to play with in sub-zero temperatures), although it is certainly a testament to QueenChelsea's editing prowess that some people believed the ice sculpture was real.\nQueenChelsea, whose real name is Chelsea Laufer, is a Canadian content creator who makes short viral videos using clever editing tricks and incredible visual effects. She included the VFX hashtag in the captions on both the TikTok and Instagram posts, and her bio on both platforms includes the sentence, \"I like making impossible things.\"\nSnopes reached out to Laufer for comment, and she replied via email.\n\"I’m a visual effects content creator so all of the videos I post are edited with a sort of magical realism in mind,\" she wrote. \"I'll also add that the response to this video has been absolutely astounding! I made this video as a way to practice working with 3D CGI, and I never expected so many people to see it.\"\nOn Jan. 18, she posted a video to TikTok breaking down how she made the effect.\n",

    },
    "summary_rationals": {
        "synthesized_rationale": "The 'Fake' rating is justified because the video depicting a woman creating a helix out of ice during the January 2024 polar vortex was revealed to be a result of visual effects and editing tricks, as confirmed by the content creator herself. The substantial social media engagement and the viral nature of the video, based on deceptive editing, led viewers to question its authenticity. The explicit mention of the use of visual effects in the captions and the creator's acknowledgment of practicing 3D CGI further solidify the video's manipulation through editing rather than a genuine occurrence.",
        "detailed_reasons": {
            "reason1": "The content creator, QueenChelsea, confirmed her expertise in visual effects and editing, explicitly stating that the videos she shares are crafted with 'magical realism' in mind. This admission indicates that the ice helix video was a product of editing and not a real-time phenomenon.",
            "reason2": "Social media metrics, such as the significant number of likes and views on TikTok and Instagram, along with inquiries to fact-checking platforms like Snopes questioning the video's authenticity, point towards the video's success in deceiving a large audience.",
            "reason3": "QueenChelsea's decision to disclose her use of visual effects by including the VFX hashtag in the video captions and addressing the video's creation as a practice in CGI reinforce the understanding that the ice helix was a digital creation rather than a genuine ice sculpture made during the polar vortex.",
            "reason4": "The post-video breakdown provided by QueenChelsea on TikTok, where she explained the process behind creating the effect, serves as concrete evidence that the ice helix was not a natural occurrence but a result of deliberate editing and visual effects manipulation."
