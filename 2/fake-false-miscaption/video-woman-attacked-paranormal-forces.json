    "article_content": "A black-and-white video shared to X on Dec. 15, 2023, consisted of grainy footage of what appeared to be a woman being dragged by her feet across the floor and down a set of stairs as she cried, “Oh, God, please. Let go of me.” At the time of this publication, the clip had received for than 1 million views:\n?pic.twitter.com/jGDC38kF46\n— Weird Things Caught On Camera (@ParanormaIVideo) December 15, 2023\n\nIt was implied that the clip was genuine and showed an attack by paranormal forces, perhaps by a ghost or demon. The username overlaid on the video made it possible to track the above clip to its first publication on TikTok to the account Virality Paranormal, which shared the video on March 3, 2023, with a caption that read: \"That demon was toying with her #paranormal #horrortok #horror #horrormovie #paranormalactivity.\"\nBut as another user on X suggested, the video originally appeared in part of the \"Paranormal Activity\" horror movie franchise. For this reason, we have rated this claim as Miscaptioned.\nSnopes searched through Paranormal Activity movie trailers made available online through the Internet Movie Database, or IMDb. We found that a portion of the video scene was shown in both the trailer and as part of the movie poster: \n (Screengrab/IMDb)\nA Google keyword search using the terms “paranormal activity 2 scene women gets pulled by feet” returned this scene from the  2010 installment, \"Paranormal Activity 2.\" The video was posted by Fandango Movieclips to YouTube on Aug. 18, 2016. \nAt the 34-second mark, the woman in the scene below is shown to be seemingly grabbed by her legs and pulled across a nursery room before being dragged down the stairs – exactly as it was shown in the videos shared on X and TikTok. \n\nBelow is a side-by-side comparison of the two at the same point in the clip, with the original being on the left and the altered version on the right: \n (Screengrab compilation by Snopes)",

        "synthesized_rationale": "The claim regarding a video showing a woman being attacked by paranormal forces was rated as Miscaptioned based on the discovery that the footage was not authentic but rather a scene from the movie 'Paranormal Activity 2.' Through a comparison of the viral video with the movie scene, it became evident that they were essentially identical, leading to the conclusion that the video was misrepresented as a real-life paranormal event when it was actually a staged scene from a movie. This discrepancy between the presented context of the video and its true origin from a horror film franchise supports the Miscaptioned rating."

This conclusion was drawn after comparing the viral video with a scene from the movie where a woman is dragged down the stairs, revealing a striking similarity between the two. The evidence of this discrepancy is highlighted by the side-by-side comparison showing the original movie scene on the left and the altered viral video on the right, indicating that the video misrepresented a staged movie scene as a real-life paranormal incident. Therefore, the evidence of the comparison supports the rationale for assigning the claim a Miscaptioned rating."
