    "rating_content": "True",
    "article_content": "On Jan. 18, 2024, an Instagram user near the Miami International Airport posted a video showing a plane that had just taken off from the airport with sparks and flames trailing behind it.\n\"Oh my god, it's on fire,\" the user can be heard exclaiming.\nA post shared by ONLY in DADE (@onlyindade)\n\nThe video went viral, and reliable news outlets like The Associated Press and The New York Times published stories about the incident. The plane, a Boeing 747 owned by cargo airline Atlas Air, took off from Miami at 10:22 p.m. before quickly declaring an emergency and landing back at Miami Airport, according to an NBC News story about the event.\nSnopes confirmed that the original video was real in two ways. First, we were able to identify the user who uploaded the video as the person quoted in news reports (and have reached out to that individual for further confirmation). Second, we noted that the user's initial Instagram story was uploaded at the same time the plane took off from Miami Airport.\nBoeing came under heavy scrutiny in recent weeks because of the events on Alaska Air 1282, where a door plug in the body of the aircraft blew off mid-air. In response, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) ordered the groundings of some Boeing 737 MAX planes so that they could be inspected to ensure they were safe.\nWhile the plane involved in the Miami incident was a Boeing 747, it was unclear what caused the plane to catch fire. So far, both the FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) have announced they will investigate the causes of the incident.\nIf the plane itself caught fire, blame might be assigned to Boeing and the maintenance crew responsible for ensuring the plane was safe to fly. If it was the engine that caught fire, the blame might be placed elsewhere â€” according to a Reuters article, the FAA announced that the plane's engines were manufactured by General Electric.",

        "synthesized_rationale": "The claim has been rated as 'True' because an Instagram video showing an Atlas Air Boeing 747 on fire after taking off from Miami International Airport in January 2024 was confirmed by reputable news sources like The Associated Press and The New York Times. Additionally, Snopes verified the authenticity of the video by matching details with news reports and user timestamps. The incident led to investigations by the FAA and NTSB to determine the cause of the fire, potentially implicating Boeing or the maintenance crew based on whether the plane or engine was the source of the fire, with the engine manufacturer also identified in the process. These comprehensive validations and follow-up investigations support the reliability and accuracy of the initial video, justifying the 'True' rating."

            "relationship_with_evidence0": "The rationale for rating the claim as 'True' is well-supported by the evidence provided in the article. The Instagram video depicting an Atlas Air Boeing 747 on fire after departing from Miami International Airport in January 2024 was corroborated by reputable news sources such as The Associated Press and The New York Times. This external validation adds credibility to the video's authenticity. Furthermore, Snopes confirmed the video's veracity by matching the user's details and timestamps with news reports, reinforcing the claim's accuracy. The subsequent investigations initiated by the FAA and NTSB to determine the cause of the incident, whether related to the plane or engine, indicate the seriousness of the event and the potential implications on Boeing or the maintenance crew. The mention of the engine manufacturer, General Electric, in the FAA's announcement further solidifies the link between the evidence, the validation process, and the implications of the incident, ultimately justifying the 'True' rating of the claim."
