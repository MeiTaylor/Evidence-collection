The page began, \"You may not share synthetic, manipulated, or out-of-context media that may deceive or confuse people and lead to harm ('misleading media'). In addition, we may label posts containing misleading media to help people understand their authenticity and to provide additional context.\"\nThe original video posted by Variety on Feb. 4 showed Swift simply walking the red carpet and posing for photos, holding no flags or banners of any kind.\nTaylor Swift is gorgeous at the #Grammys. https://t.co/Imoq8xlJM9 pic.twitter.com/ydotYDoXFI\n— Variety (@Variety) February 5, 2024\n\nAs Snopes previously reported, Swift's past expressions of her political beliefs were somewhat the opposite of the idea of embracing false conspiracy theories about the 2020 U.S. presidential election. For example, she previously expressed views in opposition to the politics of former U.S. President Donald Trump and U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee – who are both Republicans – in the 2020 documentary \"Miss Americana\" and on her Instagram account.",
