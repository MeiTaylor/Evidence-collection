    "article_content": "On Feb. 11, 2024, the @BidenHQ account on X posted (archived), \"Seconds after trying to question President Biden's mental acuity, Haley claims that 9/11 happened on 'September 10th.'\"\nThe @BidenHQ account is an official rapid-response presence for U.S. President Joe Biden's reelection campaign.\nSeconds after trying to question President Biden's mental acuity, Haley claims that 9/11 happened on \"September 10th\" pic.twitter.com/9JRMlTXaYF\n— Biden-Harris HQ (@BidenHQ) February 11, 2024\n\nThe post referenced a remark made that morning on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" by former U.N. Ambassador and 2024 Republican presidential hopeful Nikki Haley.\nAccording to the post, Haley mistakenly said the 9/11 terrorist attacks — which took place on Sept. 11, 2001 — occurred on Sept. 10.\nHowever, the context shows that Haley did not say that, so we rate this claim as \"False.\"\nAccording to the CBS News transcript, Haley said these exact words: \"The last thing we ever want to do is side with Russia. What we always need to remember is America needs to have friends. After September 10, we needed a lot of friends. We can never get into the point where we don't need friends.\"\nThis moment can be watched beginning at the 2:11 mark in this official video upload on the \"Face the Nation\" YouTube channel:\n\nThis remark did not receive widespread attention but was featured in at least two online reports. Those reports lacked the context that follows.\nKey to dispelling this rumor is the fact that the U.S. received international support the same day the attacks occurred. In Haley's own words from the Feb. 11 TV broadcast, \"After September 10, we needed a lot of friends.\" The U.S. got \"a lot of friends\" on Sept. 11, 2001.\nFor example, on Sept. 12, The New York Times reported, \"The world's governments expressed solidarity last night with the United States as a democracy under attack, and European Union foreign ministers and NATO ambassadors planned separate meetings tomorrow to discuss what could be done in a common battle against terrorism.\"\nWhile it was still Sept. 11 in the U.S., messages received within hours of the attacks also included a telegram from Russian President Vladimir Putin that promised support for retaliation, as well as a message of sympathy from President Jiang Zemin of China.\nFurther, in the months prior to Haley's remark, in a section that appeared over and over again in an apparent stump speech, Haley mentioned on multiple occasions the differences between the way Americans may have felt on Sept. 10, the day before 9/11, versus Sept. 12, the day after. That part of her speech referenced the threat of Hamas during the Israel-Hamas war and the security of U.S. borders.\nFor example, this sentiment was posted to Haley's account on X as far back as Oct. 28, 2023, after she delivered a speech in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nThe world is on fire. But here in America, we're acting like it's September 10... We need to remember what it felt like on September 12. America has to get this right. For the sake of our brothers & sisters in Israel. For the sake of the American people. #RJCVegas\n— Nikki Haley (@NikkiHaley) October 28, 2023\n\nDays later, on Nov. 2, 2023, Haley appeared on Fox News and said, \"We're acting like it's Sept. 10. And I'm telling you, America better remember what Sept. 12 felt like, because we've got an open border, and we've got terrorists that want to kill us, and we need to start acting like it.\"\nHaley repeated that sentiment about Sept. 10 and 12 in speeches available on C-SPAN's website that were recorded on Dec. 12 (32:29) and 28 (31:44), 2023, and Jan. 16 (21:25) and 19 (22:05), 2024.\nIn other words, Haley repeatedly made a point of comparing Sept. 10 to Sept. 12, emphasizing they were two very different days, separated by one day: 9/11.\nSnopes contacted Haley's campaign by email to ask about the Biden campaign post and will update this story if a response is received.",

        "synthesized_rationale": "The claim that Nikki Haley said the 9/11 terrorist attacks happened on September 10, 2001, is rated as 'False' based on a thorough analysis of the provided paragraphs. The rationale for this rating stems from the misrepresentation of Haley's actual statement made on 'Face the Nation,' where she referenced the need for friends 'after September 10' but did not misstate the date of the attacks. The article provides evidence that Haley consistently made a distinction between the days before and after 9/11, emphasizing the significance of September 12. Additionally, external sources and Haley's past speeches support the context that Haley was not confused about the date, but rather was highlighting the change brought by the tragic events of September 11, 2001. Overall, the rating is anchored in a misinterpretation of Haley's words, as she did not inaccurately state the date of the 9/11 attacks during her appearance on 'Face the Nation.'"

            "relationship_with_evidence0": "The rationale for rating the claim that Nikki Haley said the 9/11 terrorist attacks happened on September 10, 2001, as 'False' is well-supported by the evidence provided. The evidence cites a post from the @BidenHQ account on Twitter that misrepresents Haley's statement on 'Face the Nation.' While the post claims that Haley said 9/11 occurred on September 10th, the actual transcript and context reveal that she was referring to the need for friends 'after September 10.' This evidence underscores the misinterpretation present in the initial claim. Furthermore, additional evidence from past speeches and external sources demonstrates that Haley consistently differentiated between September 10 and September 12, showcasing her awareness of the significance of 9/11. Therefore, the evidence aligns with the rationale by highlighting the context of Haley's statements and the misrepresentation perpetuated in the claim."

            "relationship_with_evidence1": "The provided evidence of Nikki Haley's tweet from October 28, 2023, where she stated, 'But here in America, we're acting like it's September 10... We need to remember what it felt like on September 12,' aligns with the synthesized rationale for rating the claim as false. This tweet underscores Haley's consistent pattern of differentiating between the days before and after 9/11, emphasizing the significance of September 12 as a day of change. It supports the rationale that Haley was not confused about the date of the 9/11 attacks during her appearance on 'Face the Nation' but was rather highlighting the impact of the tragic events of September 11, 2001. Therefore, the evidence from Haley's tweet reinforces the conclusion that the claim about Haley misstating the date of the 9/11 attacks is indeed false."
