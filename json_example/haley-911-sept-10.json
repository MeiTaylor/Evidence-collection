    "claim": "2024 Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley said on \"Face the Nation\" that the 9/11 terrorist attacks happened on Sept. 10, 2001.",
    "rating": "False",
    "content": "On Feb. 11, 2024, the @BidenHQ account on X posted (archived), \"Seconds after trying to question President Biden's mental acuity, Haley claims that 9/11 happened on 'September 10th.'\"\nThe @BidenHQ account is an official rapid-response presence for U.S. President Joe Biden's reelection campaign.\nSeconds after trying to question President Biden's mental acuity, Haley claims that 9/11 happened on \"September 10th\" pic.twitter.com/9JRMlTXaYF\n— Biden-Harris HQ (@BidenHQ) February 11, 2024\n\nThe post referenced a remark made that morning on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" by former U.N. Ambassador and 2024 Republican presidential hopeful Nikki Haley.\nAccording to the post, Haley mistakenly said the 9/11 terrorist attacks — which took place on Sept. 11, 2001 — occurred on Sept. 10.\nHowever, the context shows that Haley did not say that, so we rate this claim as \"False.\"\nAccording to the CBS News transcript, Haley said these exact words: \"The last thing we ever want to do is side with Russia. What we always need to remember is America needs to have friends. After September 10, we needed a lot of friends. We can never get into the point where we don't need friends.\"\nThis moment can be watched beginning at the 2:11 mark in this official video upload on the \"Face the Nation\" YouTube channel:\n\nThis remark did not receive widespread attention but was featured in at least two online reports. Those reports lacked the context that follows.\nKey to dispelling this rumor is the fact that the U.S. received international support the same day the attacks occurred. In Haley's own words from the Feb. 11 TV broadcast, \"After September 10, we needed a lot of friends.\" The U.S. got \"a lot of friends\" on Sept. 11, 2001.\nFor example, on Sept. 12, The New York Times reported, \"The world's governments expressed solidarity last night with the United States as a democracy under attack, and European Union foreign ministers and NATO ambassadors planned separate meetings tomorrow to discuss what could be done in a common battle against terrorism.\"\nWhile it was still Sept. 11 in the U.S., messages received within hours of the attacks also included a telegram from Russian President Vladimir Putin that promised support for retaliation, as well as a message of sympathy from President Jiang Zemin of China.\nFurther, in the months prior to Haley's remark, in a section that appeared over and over again in an apparent stump speech, Haley mentioned on multiple occasions the differences between the way Americans may have felt on Sept. 10, the day before 9/11, versus Sept. 12, the day after. That part of her speech referenced the threat of Hamas during the Israel-Hamas war and the security of U.S. borders.\nFor example, this sentiment was posted to Haley's account on X as far back as Oct. 28, 2023, after she delivered a speech in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nThe world is on fire. But here in America, we're acting like it's September 10... We need to remember what it felt like on September 12. America has to get this right. For the sake of our brothers & sisters in Israel. For the sake of the American people. #RJCVegas\n— Nikki Haley (@NikkiHaley) October 28, 2023\n\nDays later, on Nov. 2, 2023, Haley appeared on Fox News and said, \"We're acting like it's Sept. 10. And I'm telling you, America better remember what Sept. 12 felt like, because we've got an open border, and we've got terrorists that want to kill us, and we need to start acting like it.\"\nHaley repeated that sentiment about Sept. 10 and 12 in speeches available on C-SPAN's website that were recorded on Dec. 12 (32:29) and 28 (31:44), 2023, and Jan. 16 (21:25) and 19 (22:05), 2024.\nIn other words, Haley repeatedly made a point of comparing Sept. 10 to Sept. 12, emphasizing they were two very different days, separated by one day: 9/11.\nSnopes contacted Haley's campaign by email to ask about the Biden campaign post and will update this story if a response is received.",

        "synthesized_rationale": "The claim that Nikki Haley stated the 9/11 attacks occurred on September 10, 2001, as presented on 'Face the Nation', is rated as 'False'. The rating is supported by the evidence that Haley actually mentioned September 10 in a broader context to emphasize the need for international support post-9/11. Additionally, her consistent references to the differences between September 10 and 12 in various speeches further clarify the misinterpretation of her statement. This demonstrates that the claim misrepresents the intent and context of Haley's remarks, leading to an inaccurate characterization of her statement.",
        "detailed_reasons": {
            "reason1": "Nikki Haley's mention of 'September 10' in her statement on 'Face the Nation' was in the context of emphasizing America's need for friends after that date, indicating a broader discussion on the post-9/11 international relations. This broader context contradicts the claim's narrow interpretation of her words, leading to a misrepresentation of Haley's actual statement.",
            "reason2": "The consistent pattern of Haley referring to the differences between September 10 and 12 in various speeches emphasizes her intended message regarding the significance of the 9/11 attacks. By repeatedly highlighting these dates in her speeches, Haley underscores the importance of understanding the impact of the terrorist attacks, which contrasts with the isolated reference used to support the claim.",
            "reason3": "The broader context provided by Haley's statement on 'Face the Nation', her historical references to the days surrounding 9/11 in previous speeches, and the global support received by the U.S. on the day of the attacks collectively demonstrate that the claim oversimplifies and distorts Haley's message. This distortion results in a false representation of her views and warrants the 'False' rating.",
            "reason4": "The lack of widespread attention to Haley's remark itself, along with the supporting evidence of international solidarity post-9/11 as highlighted in reports within hours of the attacks, further clarifies the misinterpretation in the claim. This lack of attention to Haley's statement and the immediate global responses following 9/11 invalidate the isolated focus on her use of 'September 10', reinforcing the 'False' rating."
