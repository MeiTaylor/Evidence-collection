    "claim": "A video posted to TikTok and Instagram during the January 2024 polar vortex shows a woman in Canada making a helix out of ice by pouring it on the ground in a spiral pattern.",
    "rating": "Fake",
    "content": "Every few years, when the cold, arctic air of the polar vortex plunges south, internet users around the globe are treated to viral videos about the cold snap. Examples include frozen sculptures made of ramen and clothes as stiff as a board. You can even throw hot water into the air and watch it turn into a white cloud of steam and ice.\nTikTok user QueenChelsea wanted to take it a step further in January 2024, posting a video to her TikTok and Instagram page showing her pouring water on the ground and creating a helix out of ice. The video quickly went viral, with over 13 million likes on TikTok (with 191 million views) and over 5 million likes on Instagram. The frozen sculpture looked real enough to fool many commenters, and Snopes received emails inquiring if the video was real.\n\nUnfortunately, Canada being cold was the only real part of the video. Sorry to burst anyone's bubble (another great thing to play with in sub-zero temperatures), although it is certainly a testament to QueenChelsea's editing prowess that some people believed the ice sculpture was real.\nQueenChelsea, whose real name is Chelsea Laufer, is a Canadian content creator who makes short viral videos using clever editing tricks and incredible visual effects. She included the VFX hashtag in the captions on both the TikTok and Instagram posts, and her bio on both platforms includes the sentence, \"I like making impossible things.\"\nSnopes reached out to Laufer for comment, and she replied via email.\n\"I’m a visual effects content creator so all of the videos I post are edited with a sort of magical realism in mind,\" she wrote. \"I'll also add that the response to this video has been absolutely astounding! I made this video as a way to practice working with 3D CGI, and I never expected so many people to see it.\"\nOn Jan. 18, she posted a video to TikTok breaking down how she made the effect.\n",

        "synthesized_rationale": "The 'Fake' rating for the claim that a woman in Canada made a helix out of ice in a video posted on TikTok and Instagram during the January 2024 polar vortex is supported by the fact that the video was a result of skilled editing and visual effects, as confirmed by the content creator herself. The content of the video was not a real ice sculpture but digitally manipulated, demonstrating the deceptive nature of the content.",
        "detailed_reasons": {
            "reason1": "The content creator, QueenChelsea, acknowledged herself as a visual effects content creator and disclosed the use of editing and VFX techniques in creating the video. This explicit confirmation from the creator directly supports the 'Fake' rating by emphasizing that the video was not a genuine representation but a product of editing.",
            "reason2": "The article mentions that the frozen sculpture in the video was realistic enough to deceive many viewers, leading to inquiries about its authenticity. This detail underscores the deceptive nature of the video, further solidifying the 'Fake' rating by highlighting the intent to mislead and create a false impression.",
            "reason3": "QueenChelsea's statement that she made the video to practice working with 3D CGI and never expected such a massive response indicates the video's creation for experimental and entertainment purposes rather than as a documentation of a genuine event. This purposeful creation of a visually deceptive piece reiterates the 'Fake' rating by elucidating the video's manipulation for artistic expression rather than factual depiction."

The article mentions how QueenChelsea is a visual effects content creator and that she created the viral video with editing in mind. The connection is direct and clear.

This connection is based on the fact that Snopes indeed reached out to QueenChelsea for a comment, aligning with the rationale detail. The evidence is relevant and directly supports this aspect of the article. In relation to the claim, this evidence indirectly supports the fact that the video was edited, which ultimately led to the video being rated as fake."

The video creator explicitly states that she is a visual effects content creator who edited the video using VFX techniques. This directly aligns with reason1, which emphasizes the use of editing and VFX techniques to create a deceptive video.

The content of the evidence, which is a TikTok post by QueenChelsea, where she admits to tricking half the internet, aligns perfectly with the additional rationale that mentions Snopes reaching out to Chelsea Laufer (QueenChelsea) for comment regarding the video. QueenChelsea's admission in the evidence mirrors the fact that she responded to Snopes' inquiry via email, confirming that the viral video involving the ice helix was indeed a product of visual effects. This direct relationship between the evidence and the rationale disproves the authenticity of the claimed ice sculpture, hence supporting the 'Fake' rating given to the video."
