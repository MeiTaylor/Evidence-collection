    "rating": "Miscaptioned",
    "content": "The photographs and videos allegedly showing \"Palestinian baby dolls\" were a pro-Palestinian art project and were neither made nor sold in Israel.\nThe protracted, often bloody Israeli-Palestinian conflict exploded into a hot war on Oct. 7, 2023, when the militant Palestinian group Hamas launched a deadly attack on Israel and Israel retaliated by bombarding the Gaza Strip. More than 20,000 people, the vast majority of them Palestinians, were reportedly killed during the first two months of the war alone. The violence is driven by mutual hostilities and territorial ambitions dating back more than a century. The internet has become an unofficial front in that war and is rife with misinformation, which Snopes is dedicated to countering with facts and context. You can help. Read the latest fact checks.

We welcome your participation and feedback.\nOn Jan. 12, 2024, a striking photograph was shared on X (formerly Twitter), allegedly showing a bloodied \"Palestinian baby doll\" made in Israel (and sold in Mexico). Various social media users shared the photograph of the doll in a package with text in Spanish that read \"soldados de elite\" and \"incluye bebe palestino,\" which translated to \"elite soldiers\" and \"includes Palestinian baby.\"\nOne X post captioned the image: \"How sick. They sell these… they make these… they don’t even hide their genocidal self anymore And the world watches,\"\n\nGoogle reverse-image search results showed that the images showing the doll were shared on social media platforms such as Instagram and Facebook, as well as websites in multiple languages.\nBut we found the viral images did not show an actual doll available for sale in Israel.\nWhile searching for news reports on the topic, we found an article titled, \"Unraveling Deception: The Truth Behind The Controversial ‘Israeli-Made’ Palestinian Doll.\" It read:\nPicture this: a plastic baby doll with blood strewn on his face, hands, and knees, wearing a keffiyeh around his neck, with toy Israeli soldiers around his body. If you opened Instagram, you may have come across a video depicting this Palestinian doll on Mint Press’ official page.\nSparking fury and rage across social media, everyone’s blood was boiling as Mint Press blatantly stated that this particular Palestinian doll was made in Israel and was being sold in Mexico. But, after a little digging, what Mint Press was sharing is far from the truth. We were able to find the actual creator of the doll, who carries the Instagram handle vlocke_negro.\nHe’s a Mexican man who’s presumably an activist who took a normal-looking doll from a toy shop and turned it into a Palestinian doll by smearing it in red and putting a keffiyeh around it. Then, he placed that doll among the other dolls in the store for the sole purpose of raising awareness of Palestine’s current strife. He included all this information in an Instagram post he recently shared online.\nThis is a perfect example of how we shouldn’t take all the information we’re exposed to at face value.\nIn fact, we found that the original post with the in-question photo was shared by an Instagram profile @vlocke_negro on Jan. 6, 2024. However, as of Jan. 15, 2024, the original post was marked as \"edited,\" and its description read (we translated it from Spanish):\nUPDATE UPDATE\nNo one has died during this protest that tries to make visible what happens every day in the Gaza Strip, we managed to get your attention. Now the hard facts: more than 10,000 children are dead and thousands have been injured.\nFrom a neighborhood in CDMX we demonstrate the magnitude of this genocide at a global level. They will reproach us for the manner, but what is the correct manner in the face of indifference?\nWe are with Palestine, make no mistake. On January 5 we approached the street toy merchants within the framework of \"Three Kings' Day\" to whom we explained the purpose of this project, without hesitation they lent their stalls to take a shot and some photos, taking care to do it quickly to avoid the curious looks of passers-by.\nThe post continued, explaining that the in-question doll was an activism art project, not an authentic doll available for sale:\nThis project was designed for the media and social networks, some, very few, asked us about the intentions of this project, the others responded rapaciously in search of the desired like. Toys bring us the best memories of a time when happiness was not questioned, childhood.\nThis one that evokes the most sacred and that we are letting go in a caravan of death in complicity with the United States, the European Union, of course, NATO, the organizations that guarantee global civility. An apology if we hurt or offended you. From the river to the sea, Palestine will win.\nIsraeli Elite Soldiers. Includes Palestinian baby.\nToy that I found this Three Kings Day at the Col Doctores flea market, Cdmx. Made in Israel ?\nAlso, on Jan. 16, 2024, the activist reposted on Instagram stories a post with the in-question doll with a caption reading:\nDolls from artivist @vlocke_negro’s Bebé Palestino project found a powerful place on the shelves of a doll store in Mexico City, standing as symbols of resistance and raising awareness for Palestinians. ??✊?\nWhat's more, we found a video on the activist's profile showing how he made the doll, with a caption reading, \"Reality far exceeds this intervention.\"\nPost udostępniony przez Vlocke (@vlocke_negro)\n\nFinally, we found that a fact-checking organization Lead Stories also reported on the topic on Jan. 11, 2024.\nAll in all, viral footage showed an art project of a pro-Palestinian activist rather than an authentic doll made and sold in Israel. Moreover, no reliable sources reported on similar dolls being manufactured in Israel; therefore, we have rated this claim as \"Miscaptioned.\"",

    "summary_rationales": {
        "synthesized_rationale": "The claim regarding bloodied 'Palestinian baby dolls' being made and sold in Israel was rated as 'Miscaptioned' because the photographs and videos in question were part of a pro-Palestinian art project, not actual products from Israel. The actual creator, a Mexican activist, transformed a regular doll into a symbolic object for awareness, explicitly stating the artistic purpose behind it. No credible sources supported the dolls being authentic Israeli-made products, leading to the 'Miscaptioned' rating.",
        "detailed_reasons": {
            "reason1": "The photographs and videos of the 'Palestinian baby dolls' were identified as part of an art project carried out by a Mexican activist, vlocke_negro, who repurposed a common doll to symbolize solidarity with Palestine. The clear artistic intent behind the doll's creation refutes the claim of these dolls being genuine Israeli products.",
            "reason2": "The information gathered from the Instagram post, where the activist explained the doll's transformation, emphasized that the display in the doll store was meant for activism and awareness, showcasing a deliberate attempt to convey a message rather than commercial production. This purposeful explanation discredits the notion of these dolls originating from Israel.",
            "reason3": "Despite the initial viral posts suggesting the doll was 'Israeli-made,' further investigation revealed no credible sources or evidence supporting the doll's manufacturing origin in Israel. The lack of substantiated reports on similar dolls being produced in Israel corroborates the 'Miscaptioned' rating, as the claim was based on misinformation."
