    "claim": "A video posted to TikTok and Instagram during the January 2024 polar vortex shows a woman in Canada making a helix out of ice by pouring it on the ground in a spiral pattern.",
    "rating": "Fake",
    "content": "Every few years, when the cold, arctic air of the polar vortex plunges south, internet users around the globe are treated to viral videos about the cold snap. Examples include frozen sculptures made of ramen and clothes as stiff as a board. You can even throw hot water into the air and watch it turn into a white cloud of steam and ice.\nTikTok user QueenChelsea wanted to take it a step further in January 2024, posting a video to her TikTok and Instagram page showing her pouring water on the ground and creating a helix out of ice. The video quickly went viral, with over 13 million likes on TikTok (with 191 million views) and over 5 million likes on Instagram. The frozen sculpture looked real enough to fool many commenters, and Snopes received emails inquiring if the video was real.\n\nUnfortunately, Canada being cold was the only real part of the video. Sorry to burst anyone's bubble (another great thing to play with in sub-zero temperatures), although it is certainly a testament to QueenChelsea's editing prowess that some people believed the ice sculpture was real.\nQueenChelsea, whose real name is Chelsea Laufer, is a Canadian content creator who makes short viral videos using clever editing tricks and incredible visual effects. She included the VFX hashtag in the captions on both the TikTok and Instagram posts, and her bio on both platforms includes the sentence, \"I like making impossible things.\"\nSnopes reached out to Laufer for comment, and she replied via email.\n\"I’m a visual effects content creator so all of the videos I post are edited with a sort of magical realism in mind,\" she wrote. \"I'll also add that the response to this video has been absolutely astounding! I made this video as a way to practice working with 3D CGI, and I never expected so many people to see it.\"\nOn Jan. 18, she posted a video to TikTok breaking down how she made the effect.\n",

        "synthesized_rationale": "The claim of a woman in Canada creating a helix out of ice in the January 2024 polar vortex video is rated as 'Fake' due to the video being a result of visual effects and editing tricks by a content creator named Chelsea Laufer, who openly admitted to creating the ice helix through CGI. The massive online popularity of the video mislead audiences, with the content creator confirming the use of VFX in her posts and clarifying that the video was a practice in 3D CGI, not a real occurrence. Therefore, the misleading nature of the video, the content creator's background in visual effects, and her explicit statement regarding the creation process validate the 'Fake' rating.",
        "detailed_reasons": {
            "reason1": "The video's portrayal of creating a helix out of ice during the polar vortex is debunked as fake due to the content creator Chelsea Laufer's admission of using visual effects and editing to produce the effect instead of it being a genuine occurrence.",
            "reason2": "Chelsea Laufer, known for her visual effects content creation and editing skills, openly shared that the video was crafted to experiment with 3D CGI, emphasizing the artificial nature of the depicted helix made out of ice.",
            "reason3": "Despite the convincing appearance of the ice helix in the video leading to audience speculation about its authenticity, the creator's acknowledgment of the use of VFX and CGI techniques to achieve the effect directly supports the 'Fake' rating as the result was an artificially created visual illusion."
