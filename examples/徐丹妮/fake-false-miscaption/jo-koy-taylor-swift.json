    "rating": "Miscaptioned",
    "content": "On Jan. 8, 2024, a user on X posted a video of Oscar-winning actor Emma Stone purportedly saying of stand-up comedian Jo Koy, who had just hosted the previous night's 81st annual Golden Globe Awards, \"What an a--hole.\" According to the post, after the awards show and while taking questions from members of the press, Stone had called Koy an \"a--hole\" for making a joke during the broadcast about Taylor Swift.\n\"#EmmaStone saying a--hole to Jo Koy after her [his] jokes about #TaylorSwift,\" the post read.\nHowever, while it's certainly possible that Stone was displeased with a joke that Koy had made about Swift, this rumor about her calling him a vulgar word was not true. The video was real but the caption was misleading. For rumors such as this one, we apply a rating of \"Miscaptioned\" rather than \"False.\"\nThe same video was shared by The Hollywood Reporter with the caption, \"Emma Stone jokes about getting Taylor Swift’s support at the #GoldenGlobes.\"\nEmma Stone jokes about getting Taylor Swift’s support at the #GoldenGlobes pic.twitter.com/GjlnCkXKDR\n— The Hollywood Reporter (@THR) January 8, 2024\n\nEntertainment Tonight posted a complete video of the question that a reporter had asked of Stone:\nREPORTER: Emma, I don't know if you noticed, but when you won, Taylor Swift gave you a huge applause. What are your thoughts on her cheering your win?\nSTONE: (joking) What an a--hole, am I right? No, I've known her for almost 20 years, so I was very happy she was there. And she was also nominated tonight, which was wonderful. And, yes. What an a--hole.\nThe full moment begins at the 2:54 mark in the video below.\n\nDuring the Golden Globes broadcast, Stone won the best actress in a musical or comedy award for her role as Bella Baxter in the film \"Poor Things.\" The movie also won the night's award for best comedy or musical.\nSwift attended the awards ceremony after being nominated for her concert movie \"Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour\" in a new category dubbed “cinematic and box office achievement.” That honor was ultimately given to the film \"Barbie.\"\nFollowing the monologue, Koy made a joke about Swift, which resulted in her taking a sip of her drink. Part of his joke was, \"The big difference between the Golden Globes and the NFL? On the Golden Globes, we have fewer camera shots of Taylor Swift. I swear. There's just more to go to.\"\n\nAs for Koy, his monologue was widely panned. For example, Hollywood reporter Brooke Barnes of The New York Times wrote that Koy's monologue was both \"chaotic and sloppy,\" calling it \"a train wreck.\"\n\nAt one point during his monologue, Koy added, with only a small bit of laughter and applause from the crowd, \"Yo. I got the gig 10 days ago. You want a perfect monologue? Yo. Shut up. You guys – you're kidding me, right? Slow down. I wrote some of these, and they're the ones you're laughing at.\"",

        "synthesized_rationale": "The claim about Emma Stone calling Jo Koy an 'a--hole' in response to a joke about Taylor Swift is rated as 'Miscaptioned' because although there was a video capturing a moment with these individuals, the caption misconstrued the context of the interaction. In reality, Emma Stone was jokingly referring to Taylor Swift as an 'a--hole' in a light-hearted manner that was misinterpreted. Therefore, the video's caption wrongly portrayed the situation, leading to the 'Miscaptioned' rating.",
        "detailed_reasons": {
            "reason1": "The video captured Emma Stone jokingly referring to Taylor Swift as an 'a--hole' in a jovial manner, not actually calling Jo Koy that derogatory term. This distinction between the actual dialogue and the captioned interpretation highlights the misleading nature of the claim.",
            "reason2": "The misinterpretation stemmed from the video's caption that falsely framed the situation as Stone insulting Jo Koy, whereas the full context reveals it was a light-hearted comment directed towards Taylor Swift. This discrepancy between the caption and the genuine exchange justifies the 'Miscaptioned' rating.",
            "reason3": "Additional context, such as the complete dialogue between Emma Stone and the reporter, clarifies the light-hearted nature of the interaction, further emphasizing the misrepresentation in the video's caption. The full conversation debunks the claim's initial framing, supporting the 'Miscaptioned' ruling.",
            "reason4": "Critiques of Jo Koy's performance at the Golden Globes, including descriptions of his monologue as 'chaotic' and 'sloppy,' provide a backdrop that contextualizes the nature of the event. Understanding the overall atmosphere of Koy's performance helps to comprehend the dynamics at play and adds clarity to why the claim was largely misconstrued and mislabeled."
