    "claim": "A video shared online in January 2024 accurately showed former U.S. President Bill Clinton greeting medical workers outside of a hospital in an attempt to distract the news media from his connections to the late Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted sex offender.",
    "rating": "Miscaptioned",
    "content": "On Jan. 2, 2024, a video was posted to X, formerly known as Twitter, showing former U.S. President Bill Clinton shaking hands with hospital workers. The account simply captioned the video, \"Bill?\"\n (X user @malachimaxeyusa)\nWhile the video itself appeared rather innocent, the replies to the tweet and other reposts of the same video revealed that viewers thought it was theoretically showing Clinton engaging in some sort of public relations campaign to distract the news media and general population from his ties to the late, disgraced financier and sex criminal Jeffrey Epstein. As one repost put it, Clinton was engaging in a \"Harvey Weinstein fake hurt scam.\" Epstein was back in the news after a judge ordered documents unsealed in a lawsuit filed against his associate/partner in crime, Ghislaine Maxwell.\nThe video was real, but the insinuations about it were false. \nSnopes found the same moment shown in the X clip in a video on CNN Politics. In that video, which was posted on Oct. 17, 2021, Clinton walked out of a California hospital after being treated for an infection. We cross-checked that CNN clip with an Al Jazeera article documenting the same event. Because the video is real, but the context around it is verifiably false, we have rated this claim as \"Miscaptioned.\"\nClinton has been the frequent subject of claims spread online connecting him to Epstein and Maxwell.\nAmong the claims was a video of Hillary Clinton supposedly threatening to assassinate anyone who connected her husband with Epstein (false) or photos of Epstein with the former president (true). A 2019 article from The New York Times uncovered more details about the connections between the two men.",

    "summary_rationales": {
        "synthesized_rationale": "The claim regarding Bill Clinton greeting medical workers to distract from his connections to Jeffrey Epstein was labeled as 'Miscaptioned' because although the video was real, the accompanying false insinuations about his intentions were debunked. Fact-checkers cross-referenced the video with credible sources like CNN and determined that the contextual narrative surrounding the video was inaccurate, leading to an inaccurate portrayal of the situation.",
        "detailed_reasons": {
            "reason1": "The video showing Bill Clinton greeting hospital workers was found to be real, but the interpretations and claims made about his intentions, specifically to distract from his ties to Epstein, were proven to be false. This mismatch between the genuine content of the video and the misleading implications attached to it justifies the 'Miscaptioned' rating.",
            "reason2": "Fact-checkers verified the authenticity of the video by cross-referencing it with sources like CNN Politics and Al Jazeera. By establishing the factual accuracy of the video footage itself, the focus shifted to discrediting the misleading narrative surrounding Clinton's actions, which contributed to the decision to deem the claim as 'Miscaptioned.'",
            "reason3": "The wider context provided by the fact-checking process, including Clinton's history of being targeted by online claims linking him to Epstein and Maxwell, enhanced the evaluation of this specific claim. The recurrent spread of misinformation and conspiracy theories around Clinton and Epstein reinforced the necessity to thoroughly assess and ultimately categorize this claim as 'Miscaptioned.'"
