    "content": "On Feb. 4, 2024, a user on X named il Donaldo Trumpo (@PapiTrumpo) – whose account mentions that it posts \"a little bit of parody\" – posted (archived) a video that appeared to show 14-time Grammy Award-winning recording artist Taylor Swift holding up a flag while walking the red carpet that read, \"Trump Won, Democrats Cheated.\"\n\nWhile the video may have appeared obviously fake to some users, Elon Musk's social media platform X still showed a label that was displayed under the post that identified it as \"manipulated media,\" adding a link to \"find out more\" and \"stay informed.\"\nThe link in the \"manipulated media\" label led to a policy page on help.twitter.com, which showed that remnants of the old name \"Twitter\" could still be found on the platform. The page began, \"You may not share synthetic, manipulated, or out-of-context media that may deceive or confuse people and lead to harm ('misleading media'). In addition, we may label posts containing misleading media to help people understand their authenticity and to provide additional context.\"\nThe original video posted by Variety on Feb. 4 showed Swift simply walking the red carpet and posing for photos, holding no flags or banners of any kind.\nTaylor Swift is gorgeous at the #Grammys. https://t.co/Imoq8xlJM9 pic.twitter.com/ydotYDoXFI\n— Variety (@Variety) February 5, 2024\n\nAs Snopes previously reported, Swift's past expressions of her political beliefs were somewhat the opposite of the idea of embracing false conspiracy theories about the 2020 U.S. presidential election. For example, she previously expressed views in opposition to the politics of former U.S. President Donald Trump and U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee – who are both Republicans – in the 2020 documentary \"Miss Americana\" and on her Instagram account.",

        "synthesized_rationale": "The claim that the video showing Taylor Swift holding up a flag at the 2024 Grammy Awards with the words 'Trump Won, Democrats Cheated' is rated as 'Fake' due to multiple corroborating pieces of evidence. Firstly, the original video from Variety showed no such flag, contradicting the claim. Secondly, Swift's known political stances against Trump and his allies, as documented in previous public statements and actions, further discredit the notion. Additionally, the labeling of the video as 'manipulated media' by Elon Musk's platform X adds weight to the claim's inauthenticity.",
        "detailed_reasons": {
            "reason1": "The original video posted by Variety, which depicted Taylor Swift at the Grammy Awards without any flag or banner, contradicts the description in the claim and supports the 'Fake' rating.",
            "reason2": "Taylor Swift's historically documented opposition to former President Trump and Senator Blackburn, as evidenced in the 'Miss Americana' documentary and her social media posts, undermines the credibility of the claim that she would support such a message.",
            "reason3": "Elon Musk's platform X labeled the video as 'manipulated media,' directing users to a page warning against sharing deceptive content. This additional context reinforces the lack of authenticity in the claim about Taylor Swift holding a political flag at the event.",
            "reason4": "The existence of a parody account attributed to posting the video, which humorously admitted to sharing parodic content, indicates that the initial video was not to be taken seriously as a genuine portrayal of Taylor Swift's actions."
