    "summary_rationales": {
        "synthesized_rationale": "The claim has been rated as 'True' because the video posted by Historic Vids accurately depicts UFC fighter Conor McGregor putting his arm around Russian President Vladimir Putin before removing it following a signal from an individual in Putin's entourage. The video, despite being slightly edited for brevity, authentically captures the sequence of events without manipulating their order, as supported by newspaper reports and accounts of the meeting at the 2018 World Cup.",
        "detailed_reasons": {
            "reason1": "The video, although shortened for brevity, presents the events in the correct chronological order, demonstrating McGregor placing his arm around Putin and subsequently retracting it after being gestured by a member of Putin's entourage. This sequence aligns with accounts provided by newspaper reports and the fact-checking initiative.",
            "reason2": "Reports from newspaper sources corroborate the authenticity of the depicted interaction between McGregor and Putin at the 2018 World Cup, where McGregor referred to Putin as a significant political figure. This contextual background supports the legitimacy of the encounter as shown in the video.",
            "reason3": "The fact that the video accurately captures the essence of McGregor's action towards Putin, as well as the response from Putin's entourage, adds to the credibility of the claim's truthfulness. Hence, the combination of video evidence and external verifications substantiates the 'True' rating assigned to the claim."
