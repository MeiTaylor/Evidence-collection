        "synthesized_rationale": "The claim about the video showing Conor McGregor putting his arm around Vladimir Putin, later removing it, accurately reflects events documented in the video and supported by newspaper reports and official coverage of the meeting. Even though there were concerns about the video being edited, fact-checkers confirmed that the essential context remained intact, asserting the authenticity of the depicted interaction. McGregor's action of removing his arm after a signal from Putin's entourage aligns with reports suggesting he was asked to do so. The meeting's occurrence at the 2018 World Cup, as reported by credible sources like the BBC, further supports the validity of the claim as true.",
