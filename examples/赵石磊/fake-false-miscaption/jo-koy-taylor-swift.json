    "rating": "Miscaptioned",
    "content": "On Jan. 8, 2024, a user on X posted a video of Oscar-winning actor Emma Stone purportedly saying of stand-up comedian Jo Koy, who had just hosted the previous night's 81st annual Golden Globe Awards, \"What an a--hole.\" According to the post, after the awards show and while taking questions from members of the press, Stone had called Koy an \"a--hole\" for making a joke during the broadcast about Taylor Swift.\n\"#EmmaStone saying a--hole to Jo Koy after her [his] jokes about #TaylorSwift,\" the post read.\nHowever, while it's certainly possible that Stone was displeased with a joke that Koy had made about Swift, this rumor about her calling him a vulgar word was not true. The video was real but the caption was misleading. For rumors such as this one, we apply a rating of \"Miscaptioned\" rather than \"False.\"\nThe same video was shared by The Hollywood Reporter with the caption, \"Emma Stone jokes about getting Taylor Swift’s support at the #GoldenGlobes.\"\nEmma Stone jokes about getting Taylor Swift’s support at the #GoldenGlobes pic.twitter.com/GjlnCkXKDR\n— The Hollywood Reporter (@THR) January 8, 2024\n\nEntertainment Tonight posted a complete video of the question that a reporter had asked of Stone:\nREPORTER: Emma, I don't know if you noticed, but when you won, Taylor Swift gave you a huge applause. What are your thoughts on her cheering your win?\nSTONE: (joking) What an a--hole, am I right? No, I've known her for almost 20 years, so I was very happy she was there. And she was also nominated tonight, which was wonderful. And, yes. What an a--hole.\nThe full moment begins at the 2:54 mark in the video below.\n\nDuring the Golden Globes broadcast, Stone won the best actress in a musical or comedy award for her role as Bella Baxter in the film \"Poor Things.\" The movie also won the night's award for best comedy or musical.\nSwift attended the awards ceremony after being nominated for her concert movie \"Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour\" in a new category dubbed “cinematic and box office achievement.” That honor was ultimately given to the film \"Barbie.\"\nFollowing the monologue, Koy made a joke about Swift, which resulted in her taking a sip of her drink. Part of his joke was, \"The big difference between the Golden Globes and the NFL? On the Golden Globes, we have fewer camera shots of Taylor Swift. I swear. There's just more to go to.\"\n\nAs for Koy, his monologue was widely panned. For example, Hollywood reporter Brooke Barnes of The New York Times wrote that Koy's monologue was both \"chaotic and sloppy,\" calling it \"a train wreck.\"\n\nAt one point during his monologue, Koy added, with only a small bit of laughter and applause from the crowd, \"Yo. I got the gig 10 days ago. You want a perfect monologue? Yo. Shut up. You guys – you're kidding me, right? Slow down. I wrote some of these, and they're the ones you're laughing at.\"",

        "synthesized_rationale": "The claim of a video showing Emma Stone calling Jo Koy an 'a--hole' for a Taylor Swift joke has been rated as 'Miscaptioned.' This rating is attributed to the video's caption misinterpreting Stone's jestful comment about Taylor Swift as a serious insult towards Jo Koy.",
        "detailed_reasons": {
            "reason1": "The video in question captures Emma Stone humorously responding to a reporter's question about Taylor Swift, where she refers to Swift playfully as an 'a--hole' in a jocular tone, signaling a friendly relationship, which contradicts the claim's assertion of Stone insulting Jo Koy.",
            "reason2": "Various reputable sources like Entertainment Tonight and The Hollywood Reporter provide accurate context to the video, clarifying that Emma Stone's comment was directed at Taylor Swift in jest and not at Jo Koy as insinuated by the miscaptioned post",
            "reason3": "Jo Koy's unfavorable monologue at the Golden Globes, criticized as 'chaotic and sloppy,' was unrelated to the incident involving Emma Stone, further emphasizing the misinterpretation in the video's caption that connected Stone's lighthearted banter with Koy's controversial performance."
