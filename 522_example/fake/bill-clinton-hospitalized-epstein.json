    "claim": "A video shared online in January 2024 accurately showed former U.S. President Bill Clinton greeting medical workers outside of a hospital in an attempt to distract the news media from his connections to the late Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted sex offender.",
    "rating": "Miscaptioned",
    "content": "On Jan. 2, 2024, a video was posted to X, formerly known as Twitter, showing former U.S. President Bill Clinton shaking hands with hospital workers. The account simply captioned the video, \"Bill?\"\n (X user @malachimaxeyusa)\nWhile the video itself appeared rather innocent, the replies to the tweet and other reposts of the same video revealed that viewers thought it was theoretically showing Clinton engaging in some sort of public relations campaign to distract the news media and general population from his ties to the late, disgraced financier and sex criminal Jeffrey Epstein. As one repost put it, Clinton was engaging in a \"Harvey Weinstein fake hurt scam.\" Epstein was back in the news after a judge ordered documents unsealed in a lawsuit filed against his associate/partner in crime, Ghislaine Maxwell.\nThe video was real, but the insinuations about it were false. \nSnopes found the same moment shown in the X clip in a video on CNN Politics. In that video, which was posted on Oct. 17, 2021, Clinton walked out of a California hospital after being treated for an infection. We cross-checked that CNN clip with an Al Jazeera article documenting the same event. Because the video is real, but the context around it is verifiably false, we have rated this claim as \"Miscaptioned.\"\nClinton has been the frequent subject of claims spread online connecting him to Epstein and Maxwell.\nAmong the claims was a video of Hillary Clinton supposedly threatening to assassinate anyone who connected her husband with Epstein (false) or photos of Epstein with the former president (true). A 2019 article from The New York Times uncovered more details about the connections between the two men.",

        "synthesized_rationale": "The claim that the video of Bill Clinton greeting medical workers was shared to distract from Epstein connections was rated as 'Miscaptioned' because although the video was real, the context and insinuations surrounding it were false. While online claims frequently link Clinton to Epstein, fact-checking found that the video actually showed Clinton leaving a hospital in California after treatment for an infection, contradicting the misleading narrative. The rating reflects the discrepancy between the innocuous reality of the video and the misrepresented interpretation suggesting a deliberate distraction.",
        "detailed_reasons": {
            "reason1": "The video of Clinton was found to be authentic, showing him leaving a California hospital, as confirmed through cross-referencing with CNN and Al Jazeera coverage. This authenticity contradicts the implied narrative of a planned distraction, indicating that the footage itself was accurately represented but misconstrued in the online posts.",
            "reason2": "The text highlights that while there are frequent online claims linking Clinton to Epstein and Maxwell, which adds a contextual backdrop, this specific video was not evidence of such a connection. The article debunks the false insinuations made about the video, clarifying that the content itself did not align with the misleading narrative propagated online.",
            "reason3": "The fact-checking process, as exemplified by Snopes' investigation, emphasizes the importance of verifying the context and implications surrounding a claim. In this case, the assessment distinguished between the reality of the video and the inaccurate interpretations circulating online, resulting in the 'Miscaptioned' rating to address the discrepancy."
