主要是修改了新的Relationship相关的Prompt，在prompt中明确了irrelevant、Supportive、Refute三者的区别





在prompt中明确了如果evidence的内容和rationale_text的内容之间没有直接的关系，就表明为irrelevant 



- 如果evidence的内容明确支持rationale_text的内容，才会表明为Supportive
- 如果evidence的内容和rationale_text的内容，对同一主题的含义相反，才会表明为Refute
- 其余的不直接的都表明为irrelevant



并且这么做的一个很重要的原因，是为了避免因为内容不一致导致的refute，因为之前没修改的Relationship相关的Prompt出现的一个很明显的问题就是内容不一致会识别为Refute



### 总体上感觉还是比较好的



evidence的内容和rationale_text的内容不相关就直接标为irrelevant 

其余的可能会有一些小错误，但是整体上感觉还是没问题的





### GPT的理解会有些小错误

再有些情况下确实容易产生小错误：

```
"evidence1": "@queenchelsea I accidentally tricked half the internet… ? #vfx #behindthescenes ♬ original sound - chelsea vfx"
```

```
"reason3": "The fact that the frozen sculpture in the video was so convincing that it prompted inquiries to fact-checking sources like Snopes further solidifies the understanding that the video was intentionally crafted to appear real when, in fact, it was a product of skilled editing and visual effects."
```

我个人来看感觉以上的evidence是支持reason的，但是就像是会忽略掉一些细节（指这句话“in fact, it was a product of skilled editing and visual effects.”），导致最终本应该是Supportive，但是给错为Refute

```
"relationship_between_reason3_and_evidence_1": "Refute. The evidence presented on TikTok directly contradicts the rationale detail as it reveals that the video was intentionally crafted with visual effects and editing, essentially confirming the falsified nature of the content."
```





### GPT会导致evidence和自己总结的*detailed_reason*冲突

比如说以下这个例子：

```
"evidence1": "Picture this: a plastic baby doll with blood strewn on his face, hands, and knees, wearing a keffiyeh around his neck, with toy Israeli soldiers around his body. If you opened Instagram, you may have come across a video depicting this Palestinian doll on Mint Press’ official page.\nSparking fury and rage across social media, everyone’s blood was boiling as Mint Press blatantly stated that this particular Palestinian doll was made in Israel and was being sold in Mexico. But, after a little digging, what Mint Press was sharing is far from the truth. We were able to find the actual creator of the doll, who carries the Instagram handle vlocke_negro.\nHe’s a Mexican man who’s presumably an activist who took a normal-looking doll from a toy shop and turned it into a Palestinian doll by smearing it in red and putting a keffiyeh around it. Then, he placed that doll among the other dolls in the store for the sole purpose of raising awareness of Palestine’s current strife. He included all this information in an Instagram post he recently shared online.\nThis is a perfect example of how we shouldn’t take all the information we’re exposed to at face value."
```

```
"reason2": "The Instagram post by the activist explicitly clarified the doll's purpose as part of an art project, emphasizing its role as a symbol of resistance for Palestinians, rather than being a commodity made and marketed by Israel.",
```

以下的这个refute，是跟gpt自己总结的reason的内容产生分歧了，很奇怪

感觉这种情况下说对也对，说不对也有些不对

```
"relationship_between_reason2_and_evidence_1": "Refute. The evidence directly contradicts the rationale detail by revealing that the bloodied 'Palestinian baby doll' was not made and sold in Israel as implied but was actually a transformation of a normal doll by a Mexican activist. The Instagram post misrepresented the origin and purpose of the doll, thereby opposing the emphasis on it being an art project and a symbol of resistance for Palestinians."
```











### 修改之后的新的Relationship相关的Prompt

```
prompt = f"""
The objective is to rigorously analyze the very direct and explicit relationship between specific rationale elements and evidence. Here's the specific task:
- **Input Information**: Provide the claim, its rating, a rationale detail, and the relevant evidence.
- **Synthesizing Relationships**: Evaluate whether the relationship between the rationale detail and the evidence is exceptionally direct and explicit:
- If the evidence and rationale detail cover different content without directly opposing meanings, classify this as 'irrelevant'. Clearly state that the rationale detail and the evidence discuss different matters without direct contradiction, and provide no further content under 'relationship_between_{rationale_key}_and_evidence_{i}'.Just answer one Irrelevant word, no need for any other content
- If the evidence very directly supports the content of the rationale text, classify this as 'supportive' and provide a detailed explanation of how the evidence directly upholds the rationale.
- If the evidence directly opposes the meaning of the rationale text (i.e., they make opposite assertions about the same topic), classify this as 'refute' and provide a detailed explanation of how the evidence directly contradicts the rationale.
- Any case where the evidence and rationale do not address the same topic or their meanings do not directly contradict should be classified as 'irrelevant'.
**Claim:** {claim_content}
**Rating:** {rating_content}
**Rationale Detail:** {rationale_text}
**Evidence:** {evidence}
The response should classify the relationship between the rationale detail and the evidence with absolute precision:
- 'Irrelevant' if the content or the topic addressed by the rationale and the evidence is different, or if their connection is not directly contradictory.
- 'Supportive' if the evidence very directly supports the rationale.
- 'Refute' if the evidence and the rationale  very directly assert opposite meanings about the same topic.
Ensure to avoid any classification based on indirect, vague, or ambiguous relationships.
**Specified output format in JSON:**
{{
"relationship_between_{rationale_key}_and_evidence_{i}": "Firstly, summarize as 'Irrelevant', 'Supportive', or 'Refute'. Provide an explanation only if the relationship is 'Supportive' or 'Refute'. If 'Irrelevant', no further details should be provided."
}}
Example of final output content:
{{
"Relationship_between_reason1_and_evidence_1": "Supportive. The evidence ..."
}}
Reminder: Focus strictly on very direct and explicit connections. Classify all other relationships as 'Irrelevant' and provide explanations only for very direct 'Supportive' or 'Refute' relationships.
